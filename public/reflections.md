# Lumi's Reflection :P

## What're 5 Topics You Know Very Well?
**To start off,** I was pleasantly surprised to realize that javascript had a lot of similarities with c++. I guess the familiarity helped. So, here are five topics I knew quite well.

1. **Variable Declaration**

Variable Declaration is basically how it sounds. Declaring variables so that you can use them in your code and whatnot. Personally, I just found this very, very similar to declaring variables in c++. In c++. You'd declare the variables (usually) before starting your code and you'd assign some sort of value to it. For example, "int=1". I found that it's basically the same process in Javascript, but instead we use things like let, const or var.

2. **Control Statements**

In Javascript, control statements are statements in your code that control the flow/direction of your code. I found that the control statements (like if else) are basically used and called the exact same way as control statements in c++ are.  Due to my foundation in c++, I knew how to use these very well.

3. **Loops**

Loops are used when you want to iterate several lines of codes/several conditions over and over again. Just like control statements, I was already quite familiar with loops already because I learned them in grade 8 compsci class (c++). They're basically used the same way in javascript and c++, so that was quite helpful. For example, if you want to code a for loop, you'd do it the same in javascript as you would in c++ (ex, for(i=9, i<=20, i++);).

4. **User Defined/Declaring Functions**

Functions are used to help organize your code (and they also let you reuse that code in any part of your code.) Just like control statements and loops, I was well-acquainted with functions because they were taught to me in c++. They're basically used the same way in javascript. You call them the same way and you operate them the same way, so it was quite easy for me. For example, when you want to call a function, you can either assign it to a variable or just call the function itself using its name (EX: let nm = algebraFunc(3,9);).

5. **Javascript Basic Statements**

Javascript basic statements are essentially in the name. Basic statements for generating outputs and the like in javascript. While they aren't exactly the same as basic statements in c++, they're quite similar. Because of my foundation in c++ I was able to understand them quickly. For example, when you want to output something on your browser in c++, you utilize cout <<. But, when you want to output something on your browser in javascript, you use console.log(). Even though they don' look the same, their function is still the same and that similarity helped me connect those two concepts so I could understand them.

## List at least 5 Topics You Need More Practice on and Why?

1. **Processing Functions/Processing Function Output**

While functions may be kind of familiar since I've learned them already, I still get confused with function output specifically. Sometimes I forget what to return or what to put in the little brackets when calling functions. I also found that for some reason, sometimes I blank and just forget how to call functions entirely. I guess I get a bit confused since I'm doing Javascript now so I think that it's completely different from C++, but it's really not.

2. **Using the Onclick Event Handler**

I'm already a bit familiar with onclick since I used it when I was editing my profile on a website once, but to be honest I kind of forgot the whole process after doing that. I struggle especially with remembering the structure of the event handler and I also struggle a bit with editing it using html. I can understand the html a bit better though. I also forget to put the innerHTML thing sometimes.

3. **Using the Onload Event Handler**

Just like the onclick event handler, this is usually because I make my code messy and end up confusing myself. I also get confused with the structure of the entire thing, as when I use a lot of lines of code it kind of confuses my eyes. I do remember the structure a little bit, but I also forget how to declare the variables for the different elements I want displayed (like maybe colour).

4. **Assignment Operators**

I do understand them a little bit, but I still find myself confused on how they truly work. Specifically when the operator is something like x+=y. These types of assignment operators specifically confuse me a lot and I still don't understand their outputs.

5. **Comparison Operators**

While I am familiar with them because of c++, I still find myself confused. Specifically betweem "==" and "===" and "!==" . I forget what their functions are and what they actually mean, as well as when to use them.

## Well then, What's the plan of action?
 
 **I have** a lot of ideas on how to solve it. I noticed that a lot of these just come down to the fact that my brain is oftentimes strange and confuses itself. So, here are a few tips I have made so that my brain actually works normally :,P

 1. **PRACTICE !!!**

 I actually kind of lack practice in CS which is probably why I don't understand some things and get confused a lot. I'm just planning to spend a few minutes a day doing short exercises so that I can practice. There are also short quizzes on sites like W3schools that I can utilize to get better.

 2. **Organize my code better**

 One of my main problems is that my codes usually start out messy, which just puts me through more pain because that means that I have to organize them after coding, which then sometimes leads to more errors. I used to think that organizing wasn't necessary but....now I know why. I'm planning to make my codes look cleaner so that my brain doesn't have to do backflips just to understand my own code.

 3. **Go back to my roots (c++)**

 I used to think c++ was hard, and I still kinda do (I actually prefer html and javascript), but without c++ I wouldn't have had that foundation to apply in learning Javascript. I'm planning to return to my old grade 8 notes (if I still have them). Even if I don't anymore, I can always utilize the internet.

 ## What Exercises Helped and Didn't Really Help?

 1. **An Exercise That Helped-1st Nongraded**

 Because this was the first exercise that I did, maybe I have some bias. Despite this, I think that it really helped me understand everything and just get a general feel for Javascript. It was fun and simple enough to understand but not too easy that there wasn't a challenge.

 2. **An Exercise That Helped-3rd Graded**

 This was actually one of my favourite exercises because it was really fun to do and it reminded me of those hold computer games from the 90s where you'd type in a prompt to continue the story. I thought it was a fun and interesting way to implement everything we learned and it actually helped me understand the topic more. Overall, I really like exercises that have a sort of interactive element aside from just typing in a number or a prompt (like clicking buttons :DDDDD).

 3. **An Exercise That Didn't Help-6th Graded**

 The problem wasn't the exercise itself, but the fact that I didn't really know what to do. The instructions were a bit too simple and I didn't really *understand* how to code it at first, but maybe that was just me :,). I wish that we could've maybe utilized a period in class or had it taught to us cause I found it a bit too confusing.

 4. **An Exercise That Didn't Help-4th Graded**

 While I found it quite simple, I feel like it wasn't too much of a challenge. We kind of did the same thing here as in the Weird Condition if I recall correctly, but I just found that the 4th Graded Exercise wasn't as memorable as the others. It's not bad though cause I do remember being able to do it quickly, but I just feel like there could've been more.

 # That's All! Thank you po! <3 <3

PS, you're a very good teacher in CS po so thank you for teaching us well :3
